# Introduction

## What's this?

This well-designed Metaverse middleware allows you to transform a regular XR application into Metaverse microservices, which may provide high-quality Metaverse service with edge computing technologies.

It's mainly composed of 2 Modules: Crossport and MetaCDN.

## Crossport

Crossport is a toolchain that allows you to create remote-rendered applications with Unity and [Unity Render Streaming](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.renderstreaming@3.1/manual/index.html).

## MetaCDN

MetaCDN is a content delivery system that allows you to deliver static content (assets) with [Unity Addressbles](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.addressables@1.21/manual/index.html) and to manage to render cache with Crossport in the edge computing environment.
